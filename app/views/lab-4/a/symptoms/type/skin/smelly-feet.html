      <h1>How to stop smelly feet</h1>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Smelly feet aren't fun for anyone, so good personal hygiene and changing your shoes regularly should keep your feet fresh and sweet smelling.</strong></p>
    <p>Medically known as bromodosis, stinky feet are a common year-round problem.</p>
    <p>The main cause is sweaty feet combined with wearing the same shoes every day.</p>
    <h2>Why feet sweat</h2>
    <p>Anyone can get sweaty feet, at any temperature or time of year.</p>
    <p>But teenagers and pregnant women are more likely to get them because hormonal changes make them sweat more.</p>
    <p>You're also more likely to have sweaty feet if you're on your feet all day, wear shoes that are too tight, are under a lot of stress, or have a medical condition called <a href="javascript:void(0);">hyperhidrosis</a>, which makes you sweat more than usual.</p>
    <p>Feet often become smelly if sweat soaks into your shoes and they don't dry before you wear them again.</p>

    <h2>How to treat and prevent smelly feet</h2>
    <p>The good news is that smelly feet are usually easy to treat by keeping your feet clean and dry, and changing your shoes regularly.</p>
    <p>To treat sweaty or smelly feet yourself, try to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>wash your feet with an antibacterial soap once a day (a pharmacist can advise you about different products)</li>
      <li>dry your feet well after they have been wet, especially between your toes</li>
      <li>try not to wear the same pair of shoes 2 days in a row so they have at least 24 hours to dry out</li>
      <li>change your socks (ideally wool or cotton, not nylon) at least once a day</li>
      <li>keep your toenails short and clean, and remove any hard skin with a foot file (it can become soggy when damp, which provides an ideal home for bacteria)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you often get sweaty feet, you might want to try:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>using a spray deodorant or antiperspirant on your feet – a normal underarm deodorant or antiperspirant works just as well as a specialist foot product and will cost you less</li>
      <li>putting medicated insoles, which have a deodorising effect, in your shoes</li>
      <li>using a foot powder to absorb sweat (a pharmacist can advise you about foot powders)</li>
      <li>trying socks for sweaty feet – some sports socks are designed to keep feet dry, and you can get special antibacterial socks</li>
      <li>wearing leather or canvas shoes, as they let your feet breathe, unlike plastic ones</li>
      <li>always wearing socks with closed-toe shoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
    <p>Smelly feet are a harmless problem that generally clears up. Sometimes, however, it can be a sign of a medical condition.</p>
    <p>See your GP if simple measures to reduce your foot odour don't help, or if you're worried that your level of sweating is abnormally high.</p>
    <p>Your doctor can offer you a strong prescription antiperspirant or refer you for a treatment called iontophoresis, which delivers a mild electric current through water to your feet to combat excessive sweating.</p>
