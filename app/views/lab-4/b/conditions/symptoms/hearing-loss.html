      <h1>Hearing loss</h1>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Hearing loss is common, particularly as you get older. See a GP if you have problems with your hearing. It could be caused by something that can be easily treated.</strong></p>
    <h2>Signs of hearing loss</h2>
    <p>It's not always easy to tell if you're losing your hearing.</p>
    <p>Common signs include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in noisy places</li>
      <li>asking people to repeat themselves</li>
      <li>listening to music or watching TV with the volume higher than other people need</li>
      <li>difficulty hearing on the phone</li>
      <li>finding it hard to keep up with a conversation</li>
      <li>feeling tired or stressed from having to concentrate while listening</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes someone else might notice problems with your hearing before you do.</p>

      <h3">Hearing loss in babies</h3>
      <p>Hearing loss can be harder to spot in babies. There is a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-hearing-screening-making-sounds-checklist/newborn-hearing-screening-making-sounds-checklist">checklist for how a baby makes and reacts to sound on GOV.UK</a> that can help you notice the signs.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Causes of hearing loss</h2>
    <p>There are lots of possible causes of hearing loss. It may be caused by something treatable or it may be permanent.</p>
    <p>Your symptoms may give you an idea what could be causing it. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP for advice.</p>

    <h2>Treatments for hearing loss</h2>
    <p>Treatment for hearing loss depends on what's causing it.</p>
    <p>Sometimes a GP may be able to treat the cause, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an ear infection might be treated with antibiotics</li>
      <li>an earwax build-up might be treated with ear drops or removed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your hearing loss is not caused by something a GP can treat, they may refer you to a hearing specialist for further tests and treatment.</p>
    <h3>Hearing aids and implants</h3>
    <p>If you have permanent hearing loss, a specialist will often recommend hearing aids. These will not make your hearing perfect, but they make sounds louder and clearer.</p>
    <p>Some people may need a hearing implant. These are devices that are attached to your skull or placed deep inside your ear.</p>
