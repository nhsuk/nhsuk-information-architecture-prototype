      <h1>Breast lumps</h1>

    <p><strong>If you feel a lump in your breast, you should always get it checked by a GP. Most breast lumps are harmless, but some can be serious.</strong></p>

          <li>ya lump in your breast or armpit</li>
          <li>any other unusual changes in your breasts – such as the nipple turning inwards, dimpled skin or bloodstained <a href="javascript:void(0);">nipple discharge</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changes in the breasts can be a sign of breast cancer. This is easier to treat if it's found early.</p>

    <h2>What happens at your GP appointment</h2>
    <p>The GP will look at and examine your breasts.</p>
    <p>If they're not sure what's causing the lump, they'll refer you to a hospital or breast clinic for further tests.</p>
    <p>These tests usually show that a lump is not cancer.</p>
    <h3>What happens at the breast clinic</h3>
    <p>At the hospital or breast clinic, you may have a:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>breast examination</li>
      <li>scan - usually a <a href="javascript:void(0);">breast X-ray (mammogram)</a> or <a href="javascript:void(0);">ultrasound</a></li>
      <li><a href="javascript:void(0);">biopsy</a> – where a needle is inserted into the lump to remove some cells for testing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These tests are often done during the same visit. You'll usually be told the results on the same day, although biopsy results take longer – you may have to wait about a week.</p>
    <p>Breast Cancer Now has more information about <a href="javascript:void(0);">what to expect at a breast clinic appointment</a>.</p>
    <p>Treatment for a breast lump depends on the cause. Most are harmless and may go away on their own without treatment.</p>

    <h2>Causes of breast lumps</h2>
    <p>Lumps in the breasts can have lots of different causes.</p>
    <p>They're often caused by something harmless like a non-cancerous tissue growth (fibroadenoma) or a build-up of fluid (breast cyst).</p>
    <p>Breast Cancer Now has more information about <a href="javascript:void(0);">fibroadenoma</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0);">breast cysts</a>.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, a breast lump can be a sign of something serious like <a href="javascript:void(0);">breast cancer</a>.</p>
