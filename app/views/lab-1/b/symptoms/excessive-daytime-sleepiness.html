      <h1>Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia)</h1>
    </div>


    <p><strong>Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia) is a condition where people fall asleep repeatedly during the day; sometimes in the middle of eating a meal or during a conversation.</strong></p>
    <h2>Check if it's hypersomnia</h2>
    <p>Excessive daytime sleepiness is different from <a href="javascript:void(0);">feeling tired all the time</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have hypersomnia, you may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>regularly nap during the day and not feel refreshed</li>
      <li>fall asleep during the day, often while eating or talking</li>
      <li>still sleep for long hours at night</li>
    </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>you often fall asleep during the day</li>
          <li>the sleepiness is affecting your life</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>What happens at your appointment</h3>
    <p>The GP will want to find out why you're sleeping excessively. They might:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ask you about possible causes of your sleepiness, such mental or physical health problems, or any medicines you may be taking</li>
      <li>suggest you keep a diary of when you sleep</li>
      <li>refer you to a doctor who specialises in sleep disorders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Treatment for excessive sleepiness will depend on what's causing it. It may include medicine to help keep you awake.</p>
    <h2>Causes of hypersomnia</h2>
    <p>Conditions that may be related to excessive sleepiness include:</p>
    <div class="nhsuk-table-container">
      <table><caption class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Possible causes of excessive daytime sleepiness</caption>

    <p>Some medicines, drinking too much alcohol and taking drugs can also cause excessive daytime sleepiness.</p>
    <p>Sometimes there is no known cause. This is called idiopathic hypersomnia.</p>

    <h2>Things you can try to help your sleeping habits</h2>
    <p>Changing your sleep habits may not cure hypersomnia, but it might help you feel better.</p>
    <p>Try to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>go to bed at the same time every night</li>
      <li>avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine</li>
      <li>avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine</li>
      <li>create a peaceful sleeping environment</li>
      <li>if possible, avoid medicines that can cause drowsiness</li>
      <li>avoid working late into the night</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It might also help to talk to your family and friends about your excessive daytime sleepiness so they're aware of it.</p>
