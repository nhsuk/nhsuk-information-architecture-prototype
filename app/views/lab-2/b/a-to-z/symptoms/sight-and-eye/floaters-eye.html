      <h1>Floaters and flashes in the eyes</h1>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Dots and lines (floaters) or flashes of light in your vision are common. They're not usually serious.</strong></p>

    <h2>Floaters and flashes are usually harmless</h2>
    <p>If you sometimes see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>floaters â€“ such as small dark dots, squiggly lines, rings or cobwebs</li>
      <li>flashes of light</li>
    </ul>
    <p>in your vision, it's not usually a sign of anything serious, especially if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you've had them for a long time</li>
      <li>they're not getting worse</li>
      <li>your vision is not affected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Flashes may eventually stop, and floaters often become less noticeable as you get used to them.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>floaters or flashes appear suddenly</li>
          <li>the number of floaters or flashes suddenly increases</li>
          <li>you have a dark "curtain" or shadow moving across your vision</li>
          <li>you also have blurred vision</li>
          <li>you also have eye pain</li>
          <li>floaters start after eye surgery or an eye injury</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These could be signs of a serious problem with the back of your eye, which could permanently affect your vision if it's not treated quickly.</p>
        <p>Go to <a href="javascript:void(0);">111.nhs.uk</a> or <a href="javascript:void(0);">call 111</a>. They can tell you the right place to get help if you need to see someone.</p>

    <h3>What happens at your appointment</h3>
    <p>Your eyes will be checked to see if you might need to be seen by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) for more tests or treatment.</p>
    <p>You'll usually only need treatment if you have a problem that could affect your vision.</p>
    <h2>Causes of floaters and flashes</h2>
    <p>Lots of people, particularly older people, get floaters and flashes.</p>
    <p>They're usually caused by a harmless process called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), where the gel inside your eyes changes.</p>
    <p>Sometimes they can be caused by <a href="javascript:void(0);">retinal detachment</a>.</p>
    <p>This is serious and can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated.</p>
    <p>Floaters and flashes can also happen for no obvious reason.</p>
