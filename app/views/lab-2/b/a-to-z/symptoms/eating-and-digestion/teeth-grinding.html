                <h2>What causes teeth grinding?</h2>
                <p data-block-key="kksi7">The cause of teeth grinding is not always clear, but it's usually linked to other factors, such as&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/">stress</a>, <a href="/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/">anxiety</a> or
                    <a href="/conditions/insomnia/">sleep problems</a>.</p>
                <h3 data-block-key="axzsj">Stress and anxiety</h3>
                <p data-block-key="bsaxy">Teeth grinding is most often caused by stress or anxiety&nbsp;and many people are not aware they do it. It often happens during sleep.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 data-block-key="noy3i">Medicines</h3>
                <p data-block-key="tufir">Teeth grinding can sometimes be a side effect of taking certain types of medicine.</p>
                <p data-block-key="vb8i8">In particular, teeth grinding is sometimes linked to a type of antidepressant known as a&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/ssri-antidepressants/">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</a>.</p>
                <p data-block-key="9n6kt">Examples of SSRIs include <a href="/medicines/paroxetine/">paroxetine</a>, <a href="/medicines/fluoxetine-prozac/">fluoxetine</a> and <a href="/medicines/sertraline/">sertraline</a>.</p>
                <h3 data-block-key="wt2lk">Sleep disorders</h3>
                <p data-block-key="jk47y">If you snore or have a&nbsp;sleep disorder, such as&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnoea/">obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)</a>, you're more likely to grind your teeth while you sleep. OSA interrupts your breathing while you
                    sleep.
                </p>
                <p data-block-key="9d3mx">You're also more likely to grind your teeth if you:</p>
                <ul>

                <h3 data-block-key="0sird">Lifestyle</h3>
                <p data-block-key="6p3fa">Other factors that can make teeth grinding more likely, or make it worse, include:</p>
                <ul>

                <h2>Teeth grinding in children</h2>
                <p data-block-key="nloe8">Teeth grinding can also affect children. It tends to happen after their baby teeth or adult teeth first appear, but usually stops after the adult teeth are fully formed.</p>
                <p data-block-key="gnwz1">See a GP if you're concerned about your child's teeth grinding, particularly if it's affecting their sleep.</p>
