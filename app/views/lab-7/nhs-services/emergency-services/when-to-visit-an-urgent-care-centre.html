            <h1>When to visit an urgent treatment centre (walk-in centre or minor injury unit)</h1> 
              
            

            <p>Urgent treatment centres are a facility you can go to if you need urgent medical attention, but it's not a life-threatening situation. </p>
            <p>At the moment, the NHS offers a mix of walk-in centres, urgent care centres, minor injury units and urgent treatment centres, all with different levels of service.</p>
            <p>By Autumn 2020, these will either be called urgent treatment centres or change to offer other primary health care services. </p>
            <p>Urgent treatment centres aim to offer a more consistent service wherever you are in the country. </p>
            <p>They're GP-led and open for at least 12 hours a day every day of the week (including bank holidays). </p>
            <p>They're equipped to diagnose and treat many of the most common ailments people go to A&amp;E for. </p>
            <p>You may be referred to an urgent treatment centre by NHS 111 or by a GP. You can also just turn up and walk in.</p>
            <p>Conditions that can be treated at an urgent treatment centre include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>sprains and strains</li>
            <li>suspected broken limbs</li>
            <li>minor head injuries</li>
            <li>cuts and grazes</li>
            <li>bites and stings</li>
            <li>minor scalds and burns</li>
            <li>ear and throat infections</li>
            <li>skin infections and rashes</li>
            <li>eye problems</li>
            <li>coughs and colds</li>
            <li>feverish illness in adults</li>
            <li>feverish illness in children</li>
            <li>abdominal pain</li>
            <li>vomiting and diarrhoea</li>
            <li>emergency contraception</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How to get urgent medical help</h2>
            <p>If you need urgent medical attention but it's not a life-threatening situation, you should first call 111. If you think life is at risk, you should call 999.</p>
            <p>NHS 111 will assess you and give you the option to speak to a nurse, doctor or paramedic if appropriate. </p>
            <p>You'll then be advised where you need to go for treatment.</p>
            <p>This could be an urgent treatment centre, an out-of-hours GP service, your local GP in normal hours, or the nearest A&amp;E if necessary.</p>
            <p>All urgent treatment centres have clear processes in place if it's decided you need treatment at A&amp;E rather than at the urgent treatment centre.</p>
