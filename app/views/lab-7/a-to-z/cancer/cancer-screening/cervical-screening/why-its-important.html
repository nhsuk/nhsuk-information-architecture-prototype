                    <p><strong>Cervical screening is one of the best ways to protect yourself from cervical cancer.</strong></p>
            <p>Cervical screening checks the health of your cervix. It's not a test for cancer, it's a test to help prevent cancer.</p>

                    <h2>How cervical screening helps prevent cancer</h2>
            <p>Cervical screening may check for:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>abnormal cell changes in your cervix – left untreated, this could turn into cancer</li>
            <li>human papillomavirus (HPV) – some types of HPV can lead to cell changes in your cervix and cancer</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>What is HPV?</h3>
            <p>HPV is the name for a very common group of viruses.</p>
            <p>You can get it from any kind of skin-to-skin contact of the genital area, not just from penetrative sex. </p>
            <p>Most people will get some type of HPV during their lives. </p>
            <p>Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by infection with certain types of HPV. </p>

                          <p>In future, all samples will be checked for HPV first, and only checked for abnormal cells if HPV is found. </p>
                    <p>This is called HPV primary screening. HPV primary screening is more accurate than testing for abnormal cell changes first.</p>

                            <h2>Who's at risk of cervical cancer</h2>
                    <p>If you have a cervix and have had any kind of sexual contact, with a man or a woman, you could get <a href="/conditions/cervical-cancer/">cervical cancer</a>. </p>
                    <p>Sexual contact includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>vaginal, oral or anal sex</li>
                    <li>any skin-to-skin contact of the genital area</li>
                    <li>sharing sex toys</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>You're still at risk of cervical cancer if:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>you have had the <a href="/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-human-papillomavirus-vaccine/">HPV vaccine</a> – it does not protect you from all types of HPV, so you're still at risk of cervical cancer</li>
                    <li>you have only had 1 sexual partner – you can get HPV the first time you're sexually active </li>
                    <li>you have had the same partner, or not had sex, for a long time – you can have HPV for a long time without knowing it</li>
                    <li>you're a lesbian or bisexual – you're at risk if you have had any sexual contact</li>
                    <li>you're a trans man with a cervix – <a href="/common-health-questions/sexual-health/should-trans-men-have-cervical-screening-tests/">read about if trans men should have cervical screening</a></li>
                    <li>you have had a partial hysterectomy that did not remove all of your cervix</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you've never had any kind of sexual contact with a man or woman, you may decide not to go for cervical screening when you are invited. But you can still have a test if you want one.</p>
                    <p>If you're not sure whether to have cervical screening, talk to your GP or nurse.</p>

                            <h2>Cervical screening is a choice</h2>
                    <p>It's your choice if you want to go for cervical screening. But cervical screening is one of the best ways to protect you from cervical cancer. </p>
                    <h3>Risks of cervical screening</h3>
                    <p>You may have some light bleeding or spotting after cervical screening. This should stop within a few hours.</p>
                    <p>If abnormal cells are found and you need treatment, there are some risks, such as:  </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>treating cells that may have gone back to normal on their own</li>
                    <li>bleeding or an infection</li>
                    <li>you may be more likely to have a baby early if you get pregnant in the future – but this is rare </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For more information to help you decide, read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cervical-screening-description-in-brief">NHS cervical screening leaflet</a>.  </p>
                    <h3>How to opt out</h3>
                    <p>If you do not want to be invited for screening, contact your GP and ask to be taken off their cervical screening list.</p>
                    <p>You can ask them to put you back on the list at any time if you change your mind.</p>
