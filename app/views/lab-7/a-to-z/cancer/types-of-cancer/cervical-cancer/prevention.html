      <p><strong>There's no single way to completely prevent cervical cancer, but there are things that can reduce your
          risk.</strong></p>

      <a id="cervical-screening"></a>







      <h2 class="nhsuk-u-padding-top-5">Cervical screening</h2>
      <p>Regular&nbsp;<a href="/lab-7/a-to-z/cancer/cancer-screening/cervical-screening">cervical screening</a>&nbsp;is
        the best way to identify abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix at an early stage.</p>
      <p>Women aged 25 to 49 are invited for screening every 3 years. Women aged 50 to 64 are invited every 5 years. For
        women who are 65 or over, only those who have not been screened since they were 50, have had recent abnormal
        tests or have never been screened before are still eligible for screening.</p>
      <p>Make sure your GP surgery has your up-to-date contact details so you continue getting screening invitations.
      </p>
      <p>It's important to attend your cervical screening tests, even if you've been vaccinated for HPV, because the
        vaccine does not guarantee protection against cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>If you've been treated for abnormal cervical cell changes, you may be invited for screening more frequently for
        several years after treatment. How regularly you need to go will depend on how severe the cell changes are.</p>
      <p>Although it can identify most abnormal cell changes in the cervix, cervical screening is not 100% accurate.
        This means you should report any symptoms, such as unusual vaginal bleeding, to your GP, even if you've recently
        had screening.</p>

      <a id="cervical-cancer-vaccination"></a>







      <h2 class="nhsuk-u-padding-top-5">Cervical cancer&nbsp;vaccination</h2>
      <p>The NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme uses a vaccine called Gardasil, which protects against 4 types of
        HPV, including the 2 strains responsible for the majority of cervical cancers in the UK (HPV 16 and HPV 18). It
        also helps to prevent <a href="javascript:void(0)">genital warts</a>.</p>
      <p>Girls are offered the <a href="javascript:void(0)">childhood immunisation programme</a>. The vaccine is
        routinely given to girls when they're 12 to 13 years old, with 2 doses given over a 6-month period. But it is
        available free on the NHS to all girls up to their 18th birthday. Girls who are over the age of 15 when
        vaccinated will need 3 doses.</p>
      <p>Although the HPV vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of cervical cancer, it does not guarantee that you
        will not develop the condition. You should still attend cervical screening tests, even if you've had the
        vaccine. </p>
      <p>Read <a href="javascript:void(0)">more about the HPV vaccine</a>.</p>

      <a id="avoid-smoking"></a>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-u-padding-top-5">Avoid&nbsp;smoking</h2>
      <p>You can reduce your chances of getting cervical cancer by not smoking. People who smoke are less able to get
        rid of the HPV infection from the body, which can develop into cancer.</p>
      <p>If you decide to give up smoking, your GP can refer you to the <a href="/smokefree/">NHS Stop Smoking
          Service</a>, which offers help and advice on the best ways to stop smoking.</p>
      <p>You can also call the NHS Smokefree National Helpline (0300 123 1044) and speak to specially trained staff who
        will provide free expert advice and encouragement.</p>
      <p>If you want to give up smoking but do not want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able
        to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may experience.</p>
      <p>For more information and advice on giving up smoking, see <a
          href="javascript:void(0)">10 self-help tips to stop
          smoking</a>&nbsp;and <a href="javascript:void(0)">treatments for stopping smoking</a>.</p>

      <a id="safer-sex"></a>







      <h2 class="nhsuk-u-padding-top-5">Safer sex</h2>
      <p>Most cases of cervical cancer are linked to an infection with certain types of <a
          href="javascript:void(0)">human papilloma virus (HPV)</a>. HPV can be spread
        through unprotected sex, so using a&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(0)">condom</a> can reduce
        your risk of developing the infection.</p>
      <p>However, the virus is not just passed on through penetrative sex: it can be transmitted during any type of
        sexual contact. This includes any skin-to-skin contact between genitals; oral, vaginal or anal sex; and using
        sex toys.</p>
      <p>Your risk of developing an HPV infection increases the earlier you start having regular sex and the more sexual
        partners you have, although women who have only had 1 sexual partner can also develop it.</p>
