              <div class="block-richtext"><p>Propranolol comes as 2 different types of medicine: standard release and sustained release (also called modified release).</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Standard release - releases propranolol into your body quickly. You may need to take it several times a day depending on your dose.</li>
        <li>Sustained release (SR) - this dissolves slowly so you don't have to take it as often. Once a day is usually enough. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are taking it once a day, your doctor may advise you to take your first dose before bedtime, because it can make you feel dizzy. After the first dose, if you don't feel dizzy, take propranolol in the morning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block-warning_callout"><div class="nhsuk-warning-callout">
          <h3 class="nhsuk-warning-callout__label">Important</h3>
          <p>Keep taking propranolol even if you feel well. You will still be getting the benefits of the medicine.</p>

        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="block-richtext"><h3>How much will I take?</h3>
        <p>How much you take depends on why you need propranolol. </p>
        <p>Doses for adults and children over the age of 12:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>For high blood pressure</strong>, the starting dose is usually 80mg twice a day. If this dose isn't working well enough (if your blood pressure doesn't go down enough), your doctor may increase it to a maximum of 160mg twice a day.</li>
        <li><strong>For migraine or angina (chest pain)</strong>, the usual dose is 40mg taken 2 or 3 times a day. This can be increased to 120mg to 240mg a day. Your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to split the dose over the day.</li>
        <li><strong>For irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)</strong>, the usual dose is 10mg to 40mg 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
        <li><strong>For anxiety</strong>, the usual dose is 40mg once a day which can be increased to 40mg 3 times a day.</li>
        <li><strong>For too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis)</strong>, the dose is 10mg to 40mg taken 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Doses are usually lower for the elderly or people with a kidney or liver problem.</p>
        <p>If your child is under 12 years old and they need propranolol, your doctor will usually use your child's weight to work out the right dose.</p>
        <h3>How to take it</h3>
        <p>Propranolol doesn't usually upset your tummy so you can take it with or without food. It's best to do the same each day.</p>
        <p>Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. If you find them difficult to swallow, some brands have a score line to help you break the tablet in half. Check the information leaflet for your brand to see if you can do this.</p>
        <p>If you're taking propranolol as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you don't have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Don't use a kitchen teaspoon as it won't give you the right amount of medicine.</p>
        <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
        <p>If you forget to take a dose of propranolol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.</p>
        <p>Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
        <p>If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p>
        <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
        <p>An overdose of propranolol can slow down your heart rate and make it difficult to breathe. It can also cause dizziness and trembling.</p>
        <p>The amount of propranolol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.</p>
