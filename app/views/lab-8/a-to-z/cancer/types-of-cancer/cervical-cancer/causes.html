      <p><strong>Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).</strong></p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-u-padding-top-5">Human papillomavirus (HPV)</h2>
      <p>Almost all cervical cancer cases occur in women who have been previously infected with HPV. </p>
      <p>HPV is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. There are more than 100 different types.</p>
      <p>HPV is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity, such as skin-to-skin contact of the
        genital areas or using sex toys, and is very common. </p>
      <p>Most women will get some type of HPV infection at some point in their lives.</p>
      <p>Some types of HPV do not cause any noticeable symptoms and the infection will pass without treatment. </p>
      <p>Others can cause <a href="javascript:void(0)">genital warts</a>, although these types are not linked to
        an increased risk of cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>But at least 15 types of HPV are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. The 2 highest risk are HPV 16 and
        HPV 18, which cause the majority of cervical cancers.</p>
      <p>High-risk types of HPV are thought to stop the cells working normally, which can eventually cause them to
        reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour.</p>
      <p>As most types of HPV do not cause any symptoms, you or your partner could have the virus for months or years
        without knowing it.</p>
      <p>See <a href="/lab-7/a-to-z/cancer/types-of-cancer/cervical-cancer/prevention">preventing cervical cancer</a> for more information about
        reducing your chances of developing an HPV infection.</p>

      <a id="pre-cancerous-cervical-abnormalities"></a>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-u-padding-top-5">Pre-cancerous cervical abnormalities</h2>
      <p>Cancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. Before it does, the cells in the cervix often show
        changes. </p>
      <p>These cervical abnormalities are known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or, less commonly, cervical
        glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN) depending on which cells are affected.</p>
      <p>CIN and CGIN are pre-cancerous conditions. Pre-cancerous conditions do not pose an immediate threat to a
        person's health. But if they're not checked and treated, they can potentially develop into cancer.</p>
      <p>However, even if you develop CIN or CGIN, the chances of them turning into cervical cancer are very small. </p>
      <p>And if the changes are discovered during <a href="javascript:void(0)">cervical screening</a>,
        treatment is highly successful.</p>
      <p>The progression from HPV infection to developing CIN or CGIN and then cervical cancer is very slow, often
        taking 10 to 20 years.</p>

      <a id="increased-risk"></a>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-u-padding-top-5">Increased risk</h2>
      <p>HPV infection being very common but cervical cancer relatively uncommon suggests that only a very small
        proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an HPV infection. </p>
      <p>There appear to be additional risk factors that affect a woman's chance of developing cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>smoking – women who smoke are twice as likely to develop cervical cancer than those who do not smoke; this
          may be because of the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix</li>
        <li>having a weakened immune system </li>
        <li>taking the <a href="javascript:void(0)">oral contraceptive pill</a> for
          more than 5 years – this risk is not well understood</li>
        <li>having more than 5 children, or having them at an early age (under 17 years old) </li>
        <li>your mother taking the hormonal drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) while pregnant with you – your GP can discuss
          these risks with you</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. </p>
      <p>One theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the
        effects of HPV.</p>
