      </h1>








          <section>







                <p><strong>Your cervical screening results are usually sent to you in a letter. Sometimes you may be asked to call your GP to get the results.</strong></p>


          </section>






          <section>







                <h2>When your results should arrive</h2>
        <p>You should get your results within 14 days. But they can take longer to arrive.</p>
        <p>If you have waited longer than you expected, call your GP surgery to see if they have any updates.</p>

          <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
          <p>Try not to worry if your results are taking a long time to get to you. </p>
        <p>It does not mean anything is wrong, and most people will have a normal result.</p>

        </div>

          <section>







                <h2>What your results mean</h2>
        <p>Your results letter will explain what was tested for and what your results mean.</p>
        <p>Most people will have a normal result. This means you do not need any further tests and you'll be invited for screening again in 3 or 5 years.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you'll be asked to come back in 3 months to have the test again. This does not mean there's anything wrong – it's because the results were unclear.</p>
        <h3>If you have an abnormal result</h3>
        <p>Your results letter should explain what will happen next. </p>
        <p>You may need:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>no treatment</li>
        <li>another cervical screening test in 1 year</li>
        <li>a different test to look at your cervix (colposcopy)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are different kinds of abnormal result depending on if your sample was tested for:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>abnormal cell changes in your cervix – left untreated, this could turn into cancer</li>
        <li>HPV – some types of HPV can lead to cell changes in your cervix and cancer</li>
        </ul>


                <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
          <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
          <p>HPV is a common virus and most people will get it in their life. You can get it through any kind of sexual contact.</p>

        <p>A colposcopy is a simple procedure to look at your cervix. </p>
        <p>It's similar to having cervical screening, but it's carried out in hospital.</p>
        <p>You might need one if your results show changes to the cells of your cervix. </p>
