            <h2>When cervical screening is not recommended</h2>
    <h3>If you're under 25</h3>
    <p>You will not be invited for cervical screening until you're 25 because:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>cervical cancer is very rare in people under 25</li>
    <li>it might lead to having treatment you do not need â€“ abnormal cell changes often go back to normal in younger women</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If you're 65 or older</h3>
    <p>You'll usually stop being invited for screening once you turn 65. This is because it's very unlikely that you'll get cervical cancer.</p>
    <p>You'll only be invited again if 1 of your last 3 tests was abnormal.  </p>
    <p>If you're 65 or older and have never been for cervical screening, or have not had cervical screening since the age of 50, you can ask your GP for a test.</p>
    <h3>If you have had a total hysterectomy</h3>
    <p>You will not need to go for cervical screening if you have had a total hysterectomy to remove all of your womb and cervix. </p>
    <p>You should not receive any more screening invitation letters.</p>
