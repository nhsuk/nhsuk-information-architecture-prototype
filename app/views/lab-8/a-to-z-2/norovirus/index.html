              Norovirus, also called the "winter vomiting bug", is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea. It
              can be very unpleasant, but usually goes away in about 2 days.

                <h2>Check if you have norovirus</h2>
                <p>The main symptoms of norovirus are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>
                  <li>diarrhoea</li>
                  <li>being sick (vomiting)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may also have:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>a high temperature of 38C or above</li>
                  <li>a headache</li>
                  <li>aching arms and legs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The symptoms start suddenly within 1 to 2 days of being infected.</p>
                <h2>How to treat norovirus yourself</h2>
                <p>You can usually treat yourself or your child at home.</p>
                <p>You should start to feel better in 2 to 3 days.</p>

                <p>Stay off school or work until the symptoms have stopped for 2 days. Also avoid visiting anyone in
                  hospital during this time.</p>
                <p>This is when you're most infectious.</p>
                <h2>How norovirus is spread</h2>
                <p>Norovirus can spread very easily.</p>
                <p>You can catch norovirus from:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>close contact with someone with norovirus</li>
                  <li>touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them, then touching your mouth</li>
                  <li>eating food that's been prepared or handled by someone with norovirus</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Washing your hands frequently with soap and water is the best way to stop it spreading. Alcohol hand
                  gels do not kill norovirus.</p>
