              <p>You're entitled to ask for a referral for specialist treatment on the NHS. </p>
              <p>But whether you'll get the referral depends on what your GP feels is clinically necessary in your case.</p>
              <p>If you wish to be referred to a specialist in a particular field, such as a surgeon or a gynaecologist (a specialist in the female reproductive system), you should see the GP you're registered with. </p>
              <p>This is because all your <a href="javascript:void(0)">medical records</a> are held by that practice. </p>
              <p>Your GP also generally understands your health history and treatments better than anyone and will base any decision for a specialist referral on this knowledge. </p>
              <p><a href="javascript:void(0)">Find out if you can  demand a specific treatment</a></p>
              <p>If you ask your GP to refer you to a specialist, they'll probably suggest that you first try various tests or treatment options to see whether your condition improves.</p>
              <p>Generally, you cannot self-refer to a specialist within the NHS, except when accessing <a href="javascript:void(0)">sexual health clinics</a> or <a href="javascript:void(0)">A&amp;E treatment</a>.</p>
              <p>A specialist will only see you with a letter of referral from your GP. </p>
              <p>The letter will give the specialist essential background information, such as your medical history, and it'll also contain details that the specialist needs to pay particular attention to.</p>
              <p>For more information, read this <a href="javascript:void(0);">leaflet about what happens when you're referred (PDF, 596kb)</a>. </p>
              <p>The leaflet is also available as a <a href="javascript:void(0);">black and white version (PDF, 316kb)</a>.</p>
              <p>If you want to see a private specialist, you're still advised to get a letter of referral from your GP. </p>
              <p>But whether you see a private specialist, with or without a GP referral, or are referred to an NHS specialist, your GP is not obliged to accept the specialist's recommendations. </p>
              <p><a href="javascript:void(0)">Find out if you need a referral for private treatment</a></p>
              <p>When doctors write to each other about your care, they should aim to give you a copy of their letters or emails.</p>
              <p>If you do not get a copy, you can ask for one.</p>
              <h3>Choosing a hospital or consultant</h3>
              <p>If you're referred to a specialist by your GP or another health professional, such as a dentist or ophthalmologist, you may have the right to choose which hospital in England to go to for your first <a href="javascript:void(0)">outpatient appointment</a>.</p>
              <p>You can also choose which consultant-led team will be in charge of your treatment. </p>
              <p>This means that if you choose a particular consultant for a procedure, you can choose to have your first outpatient appointment at the hospital where the consultant works and be treated by that consultant's team.</p>
              <p><a href="javascript:void(0)">Find out more about consultant choice</a></p>
              <p>Once you have decided on a hospital, you could book your first outpatient appointment through the <a href="/lab-7/nhs-services/hospitals/e-referrals-service">NHS e-Referral Service</a>. </p>
              <p>This can happen in the following ways:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>your GP can book it while you're at the surgery</li>
              <li>you can book it online using the appointment request letter your GP gives you</li>
              <li>you can phone the NHS e-Referral Service line on 0345 608 8888 (open Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm, and on weekends and bank holidays from 8am to 4pm)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><a href="javascript:void(0)">Find out more about patient choice of hospitals</a></p>
              <p>Under the <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="External website">NHS Constitution</a>, if your GP refers you for a condition that's not urgent, you have the right to start treatment led by a consultant within 18 weeks from when you're referred, unless you want to wait longer or waiting longer is clinically right for you. </p>
              <p><a href="javascript:void(0)">Find out more about waiting times</a></p>
              
              <h2>Other services you may access through your GP</h2>
              <p>As well as specialist referrals, your GP can help you find the right stop smoking services, weight loss service or other self-management programmes that help prevent or manage a condition. </p>
              <p>Self-management programmes are not simply about educating you about your condition. </p>
              <p>They also let you take control of your health by learning new skills to manage your condition on a daily basis. </p>
              <p>But these services may not be available on the NHS and you may have to pay for them yourself.</p>
              <p>Some areas may offer local schemes that allow patients to have subsidised access to gyms or weight loss services such as WeightWatchers, Slimming World or Rosemary Conley. </p>
              <p>It's worth asking your GP if there are any schemes available in your area.</p>
