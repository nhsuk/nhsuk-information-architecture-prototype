      <h1>Opt out of sharing your health records</h1>

      <h2>Why your data is important</h2>
      <p>The NHS uses information about patients (patient data) to research, plan and improve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the services we offer</li>
        <li>the treatment and care patients receive</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We get this data from your GP surgery, hospitals and other healthcare providers. The organisation that collects your data is called <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">NHS Digital</a>.</p>
      <p>To help improve services, NHS Digital shares this data with researchers from organisations such as universities or hospitals. This type of data-sharing has been happening for many years.</p>
      <p>All data that is collected and shared is protected by strict rules around privacy, confidentiality and security.</p>

        <p data-block-key="nfvug">We never sell patient data or share it with insurance or marketing companies.</p>
